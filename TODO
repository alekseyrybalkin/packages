TODO LIST
MAJOR/INTERESTING:
- sandboxing
- systemd ?
- btrfs ? snaphosts as backups?
- SELinux: http://opensource.com/business/13/11/selinux-policy-guide
- add gtk-doc
- use gnupg2
- create /run/postgresql somethere (check how it works on snowden first)
- kiin l/links/linked-by: usage of individual libs (by individual libs/binfiles) is also interesting
- fix setuid for xlockmore somehow
  inspect all suid files, do we need them?
- run tests/checks for packages
- check tarball integrities whenever possible
  [ http://allanmcrae.com/2012/04/how-secure-is-the-source-code/ ]
- sign packages with gpg key and check it before install/upgrade
- check version differences in db and package files
  e.g. version 1.3 in package.sh, but 1.2 in system
- same / git repo --> as a package with seds in kiin (kiin-configs)
  and add swapfile to snowden
- package kiin
  and control that kiin runs commands strictly as root/user
  and no auto-sudo for kiin

NORMAL:
- get rid of fix_symlinks.py, all packages should put things in the right places without it
- pull from upstream for /var/src/${pkgname} before building, fail gracefully without network/availability
  update git/svn/hg repositories once in a while
- check-system-integrity: check for differences in kiin-configs and actual files
- remove FHS trash like /usr/local from filesystem
- implement `evaluate-update` to show which links changed, which libs/bins added/removed
- remove empty dirs from packages
- check-system-integrity: check for empty dirs in system dirs (used and not used)
- strip binaries/libs by default, but add option to not strip
- kiin u does not fail when one of the parameters is not a valid package
- kiin u does not fail when one of packages fails
- pciutils: https cert failure for download / check-server-version
- maybe we should collect kiin-knowns from responsible packages?
- maybe even collect check-updates exceptions from packages?
- add meta-information to packages (e.g. build time, last updated, libraries provided, etc.)
- kiin: optimize working on packages with lots of files (e.g. python,ncurses,glibc,perl)
- kiin rebuild-world: do not fail if some package does not build, just move on
  and in the end show which ones failed
- fix initramfs for rebuild-world (get rid of sudo)
- fix running kiin concurrently
- fix gen-db bug about spaces in file names

MINOR:
- kiin: checking of hashsums of installed files <- do we need this?
  kiin: checking of permissions of installed files/dirs <- do we need this?
- add ability to read chm (xchm)
- kiin: remove broken symlinks before upgrade (see TODO in the executable file)
- list all proprietary shit in my system (like bios, games, wifi firmware, jdk, ideau, skype, etc.)
- list all packages and make dependencies which are pre-built binaries (jdk, maven, ideau)
- fix some packages to not need internet connection for building (cacerts, libreoffice)
- fix code downloaded from internets: gajim/firefox plugins
- check for new tags in repositories?
- add p7zip
- implement kiin_after_uninstall
- check package needness: prelink
