TODO LIST
- configure backups
- check /boot partition after boot for tampering
  don't start network if tampering is detected
  auto-update hashes when upgrading linux/grub/initramfs/kiin-git
- implement sane glibc, ncurses, readline upgrade
- add support for post-install/post-upgrade scripts
- fix setuid for xlockmore somehow
- configure iptables
- add meta-information to packages (e.g. ./configure && make log, make install log,
  build time, last updated, libraries provided, dependencies for libraries and binaries, etc.)
- fail if any operation fails during kiin make (especially kiin_install(), I am looking at you)
- kiin: checking of hashsums of installed files <- do we need this?
  kiin: checking of permissions of installed files/dirs <- do we need this?
  kiin: optimize working on packages with lots of files (e.g. boost,python,ncurses,glibc,perl)
- kiin l/links/linked-by: usage of individual libs (by individual libs/binfiles) is also interesting
- customize boot/shutdown (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter07/site.html)
  update bootscripts
- carry entropy pool across reboots (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/random.html)
- add ability to read chm and djvu (xchm && djvulibre)
- fix alsa volume on boot
- control that kiin runs commands strictly as root/user
- after upgrade note which packages you'll probably want to rebuild
- kiin: remove broken symlinks before upgrade (see TODO in the executable file)
- fix sound for libvpx in firefox (maybe blacklist all alsa devices except intel?)
- list all proprietary shit in my system (like bios, wifi firmware, games, etc.)
