TODO LIST
MAJOR/INTERESTING:
- kiin l/links/linked-by: usage of individual libs (by individual libs/binfiles) is also interesting
- fix setuid for xlockmore somehow
- run tests/checks for packages
- check tarball integrities whenever possible
- update git/svn/hg repositories once in a while
- check version differences in db and package files

NORMAL:
- fix iproute2 and xorg-xmodmap builds with gcc 4.8
- find out why procps installed some strange hardlinks for man pages
- maybe we should collect kiin-knowns from responsible packages?
- add meta-information to packages (e.g. build time, last updated, libraries provided, etc.)
- kiin: optimize working on packages with lots of files (e.g. python,ncurses,glibc,perl)
- kiin rebuild-world: do not fail if some package does not build, just move on
  and in the end show which ones failed
- fix initramfs for rebuild-world (get rid of sudo)
- fix running kiin concurrently
- fix gen-db bug about spaces in file names

MINOR:
- kiin: checking of hashsums of installed files <- do we need this?
  kiin: checking of permissions of installed files/dirs <- do we need this?
- add ability to read chm (xchm)
- control that kiin runs commands strictly as root/user
- kiin: remove broken symlinks before upgrade (see TODO in the executable file)
- list all proprietary shit in my system (like bios, games, etc.)
- test for stale tar.gz's (not moved to trash) in checklist
- check for new tags in repositories?
- add p7zip
- add drill (ldns)
- implement kiin_after_uninstall
- add ntp
