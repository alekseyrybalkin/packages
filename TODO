TODO LIST
MAJOR/INTERESTING:
- configure backups
- should we check if shared libraries are used by running processes (lsof?)?
- kiin l/links/linked-by: usage of individual libs (by individual libs/binfiles) is also interesting
- after upgrade note which packages you'll probably want to rebuild in correct order
  and maybe even automate this rebuild (though I know it is redundant in most cases)
- fix setuid for xlockmore somehow
- configure iptables

NORMAL:
- maybe we should collect kiin-knowns from responsible packages?
- add meta-information to packages (e.g. ./configure && make log, make install log,
  build time, last updated, libraries provided, etc.)
- fail if any operation fails during kiin make (especially kiin_install(), I am looking at you)
- kiin: optimize working on packages with lots of files (e.g. boost,python,ncurses,glibc,perl)

MINOR:
- kiin: checking of hashsums of installed files <- do we need this?
  kiin: checking of permissions of installed files/dirs <- do we need this?
- add ability to read chm and djvu (xchm && djvulibre)
- control that kiin runs commands strictly as root/user
- kiin: remove broken symlinks before upgrade (see TODO in the executable file)
- fix sound for libvpx in firefox (maybe blacklist all alsa devices except intel?)
- list all proprietary shit in my system (like bios, wifi firmware, games, etc.)
- catch and fix a bug with kiin-known (?) showing up twice and triggering dups
- kiin check-updates: add options to show exceptions and upper-to-date packages
