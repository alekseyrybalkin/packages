TODO LIST
MAJOR/INTERESTING:
- SELinux: http://opensource.com/business/13/11/selinux-policy-guide
- add gtk-doc
- use gnupg2
- create /run/postgresql somethere
- duplicates in kiin-known
- kiin l/links/linked-by: usage of individual libs (by individual libs/binfiles) is also interesting
- fix setuid for xlockmore somehow
- run tests/checks for packages
- check tarball integrities whenever possible
  [ http://allanmcrae.com/2012/04/how-secure-is-the-source-code/ ]
- sign packages with gpg key and check it before install/upgrade
- update git/svn/hg repositories once in a while
- check version differences in db and package files
  e.g. version 1.3 in package.sh, but 1.2 in system
- same / git repo --> as a package with seds in kiin (kiin-configs)
  and add swapfile to snowden
- package kiin
  and control that kiin runs commands strictly as root/user
  and no auto-sudo for kiin

NORMAL:
- pciutils: https cert failure for download / check-server-version
- find out why procps installed some strange hardlinks for man pages
- maybe we should collect kiin-knowns from responsible packages?
- maybe even collect check-updates exceptions from packages?
- add meta-information to packages (e.g. build time, last updated, libraries provided, etc.)
- kiin: optimize working on packages with lots of files (e.g. python,ncurses,glibc,perl)
- kiin rebuild-world: do not fail if some package does not build, just move on
  and in the end show which ones failed
- fix initramfs for rebuild-world (get rid of sudo)
- fix running kiin concurrently
- fix gen-db bug about spaces in file names

MINOR:
- kiin: checking of hashsums of installed files <- do we need this?
  kiin: checking of permissions of installed files/dirs <- do we need this?
- add ability to read chm (xchm)
- kiin: remove broken symlinks before upgrade (see TODO in the executable file)
- list all proprietary shit in my system (like bios, games, wifi firmware, jdk, ideau, skype, etc.)
- list all packages and make dependencies which are pre-built binaries (jdk, maven, ideau)
- fix some packages to not need internet connection for building (cacerts, libreoffice)
- fix code downloaded from internets: gajim/firefox plugins
- check for new tags in repositories?
- add p7zip
- implement kiin_after_uninstall
